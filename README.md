# Economic_Analysis


#### With the  economic crisis ravaging the global economy as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ever rising energy prices. I decided to take a good look at 
at some economic indices of some selected countries and how these indices are related and differ  from countries to countries,  regions to regions and organisation to organisation. 
I carried out Explanatory and Exploratory anlysis to understand their relationship and further provide more insights on how Developed and Developing economies work with relation to
these indices
