# Economic_Analysis


#### With the  economic crisis ravaging the global economy as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ever rising energy prices. I decided to take a good look at  some economic indices of some selected countries and how these indices are related and differ  from countries to countries,  regions to regions and organisation to organisation. I carried out Explanatory and Exploratory anlysis to understand their relationship and further provide more insights on how Developed and Developing economies work with relation to these indices. Some key  questions needed to be asked before any explanatory or expoloratory analysis is carried out

#### Research Questions

> 1a. Countries within organisation and  regions with the highest and lowest inflation in the last 23 years.

> 1b. Which country within the the selected Sub Saharan countries have the highest foreign debt


> 1c.  Countries within the selected organisations and regions with the highest and lowest  Trade Balance


> Research Questions (2)
> 2a. Does inflation has any effect on Foreign debt

> 2b. Do countries with high foreign debt  have high Gross capital formation

> 2c. Is there any substantial  effect of foreign debt on Trade balance

> 2d. Does inflation have any effect or impact on Gross capital formation

> 2e. Countries and regions with the highest Trade Balance

> 2f. Effect of Gross capital formation on  Trade Balance


> Research Questions (3):

> 3a. Does the relationship between inflation  and Foreign_debt vary with countries

> 3b. Do all countries involved in the analysis follow the same relationship that exist with Trade_balance and Gross capital formation

> 3c. Is the impact of inflation on Gross capital formation the same for all countries involved in the analysis

> 3d. Does inflation have a general effect on Foreign_debt 

> 3e. Is the effect of Foreign_debt on Trade_balance the same for all countries
